# StudentDataAnalyzer with Stream Pipelines

This project is designed to practice and demonstrate the use of Java Stream pipelines, including common intermediate and terminal operations, and parallel stream processing. The program analyzes a list of student records to provide insights such as filtering high achievers, collecting student names, finding the oldest student, and demonstrating parallel stream processing for average grade calculations.

## Project Structure
- `lib`: Contains classes representing student data and methods for stream operations.
- `main`: Contains the main application class to run the analysis.

## Key Features
- Filters students with an average grade above 80.
- Collects and prints student names as a comma-separated string.
- Identifies the oldest student in the dataset.
- Demonstrates parallel stream usage for concurrent data processing.
